# 📜 About
**Legacy4J** is a mod about nostalgia of old 4J Studios Minecraft Legacy Edition. The main objective of this mod is remake every aspect of [Legacy Console Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Legacy_Console_Edition) in 1:1 for Java Edition versions, adding its exclusive features, and bringing it to modern versions.

This includes the crafting menu, creative flight, the gamma system, the hud, and more!
