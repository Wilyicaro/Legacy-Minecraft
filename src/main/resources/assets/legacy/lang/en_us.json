The first step in the battle is to destroy each of these. The first few can be reached with arrows, but several are protected by an Iron Fence cage; you will need to build up to them.\n\nWhile you are doing this, the Ender Dragon will be attacking by flying at you and spitting balls of Ender acid. If you approach the Egg Podium in the center of the spikes, the Ender Dragon will fly down and attack you. This is where you can really do some damage to it! Avoid the acid breath and target the Ender Dragon's eyes for the highest damage. If possible, bring some friends into The End to help you with the battle!\n\nOnce you are in The End, your friends will be able to see the location of the End Portal within the Stronghold on their maps, so they can easily join you.",
